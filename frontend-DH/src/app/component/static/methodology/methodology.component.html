            <hr><br>
            <p> The Global Research Map (GRM) is a comprehensive and multi-faceted map that provides a clear landscape
                of Research and Development (R&amp;D) activities across different world regions and the state of
                maturity of various National Digital Health Strategies (NDHS). The GRM is a powerful tool capable of
                providing a clear situational awareness to countries, regions, Funders and multilateral organisations to
                visualise, analyse and act according to identified gaps and needs in different settings. It will provide
                an inclusive vision that explicitly underlines the dual link between the integration of the Research and
                Development landscape in the national digital health strategy and the impact of national digital health
                strategy on the evolution of the national research and development outputs. </p>
            <p> The overall vision of the GRM is to provide a global landscape that can serve for the identification of
                existing international research and development networks, reinforcement of cooperation and collaboration
                and the nature and scope of exchanges between developed countries and the LMIC. This will underline the
                potential of different countries in producing their own research and development and the roadmap to
                achieve such national vision. It will also help in the establishment of regional joint research capacity
                and to quickly identify major actors, trends and important investigational subjects at the regional and
                national level. The GRM will also help in the identification of best practices for the shaping of
                National Digital Health strategy that can match the better with the regional or the country profile.
                These best practices will constitute a practical and living guide for the development of efficient and
                up to date national strategies. </p>
            <p> This dual benchmarking provides a comprehensive vision that addresses both the strategic and the
                executive levels. The developed GRM brings a better clarity to address, in a holistic approach, the full
                spectrum of digital health and AI development from the ground to the policy makers. The GRM could
                provide a floor to discussions in global policy bodies. Relevant stakeholders can use it in conjunction
                with the detailed customised report to identify policy and governance gaps in AI and digital health for
                the achievement of universal health care and the sustainable development goal (SDG.3). It also helps
                donors, development agencies and Digital health actors to quickly identify areas of interest for
                investment and development. </p>

            <h5><strong> R&amp;D Digital Health Methodology </strong></h5>
            <p> I-DAIR has developed a taxonomy that is applicable for both publications and patents in the digital
                health field. All attributes and classes of interest are grouped in 5 top level categories - type of
                medical device/software, purpose of medical device/software, healthcare information technology,
                healthcare analytics and enabling technologies. Each category has at least 5 sub-categories with several
                of them branching into smaller individual classes - for example, there are 16 classes in the
                disease/disorder targeted category within the purpose of medical device/software category. The taxonomy
                currently has a total of three tiers. Papers and patents both can belong to multiple categories in each
                tier, making this taxonomy overlapping in nature. </p>
            <p> In order to connect the data points to the geographical (9 regions with individual countries),
                socioeconomic (LMIC or not) and taxonomic categories, I-DAIR has partnered with <a
                    href="https://www.patsnap.com/">PatSnap</a>. This company takes the data from the free available
                databases of patents and publications, structures and cleans it using manual curation and proprietary
                AI. The added semantic layer is added to select a subset of 142 million data points and connect them to
                I-DAIR’s taxonomy and dashboards. </p><br>
            <h5><strong>NDHS maturity benchmarking </strong></h5>
            <p> I-DAIR structured the digital health strategy as a dual problem - on one side, it is affected by the
                individual state of IT and Healthcare, and the joint digital health on the other. Further on, by
                recognizing that the present state should be considered separately from the prospective development,
                I-DAIR defined a number of indicators in both the present and the future states. Present indicators are
                evaluated according to availability and readiness, while the future ones are evaluated for development
                strategy and capacity building. Each of these individual evaluations are performed through a number of
                yes/no questions translating to different scores and yielding a total score from 0-100 for each
                indicator aspect. The questions belonging to an indicator aspect are frequently scored with groups of
                chained value logic - if the first (main) question in a group is negative, no others can be answered.
                For example, in the Healthcare Governance Availability indicator there is a group of 4 questions
                concerning Health Insurance for Citizens and offering a maximum of 25 points. Answering “no” to the
                question “Is there a Federal Health Insurance Fund Available?” gives 0 score for the group, while
                answering “yes” contributes 6 points and unlocks additional questions like “Is the Health Insurance
                Available only to low income group/elderly people?” and others. </p>
            <p> The taxonomy classes for each country were populated in a collaboration between I-DAIR and <a
                    href="https://en.xlpat.com/">Xlpat</a>. Online sources of information were researched and all the
                questions were answered with “yes”, “no” or “no data available” if the online search didn’t provide
                results. At this point the latter category is treated as a negative answer regarding the score, but is
                open to additional research. </p>
            <p> All the results are grouped per country into two groups taken as axes for the new digital strategy world
                map - present and future development, each with its own indicators. An appropriate simple similarity
                measure is used to quantify the level of agreement between individual countries, and are then clustered
                according to it into 6 groups (“continents”) which represent countries with similar levels of present
                and future development, thus enabling comparison and systematic review of healthcare systems and
                possible improvements. </p><br>
            <p> Within this perspective, the GRM developed within I-DAIR is essentially providing the following
                features: <br> ● National Digital Health Strategy benchmarking </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Based on existing and publicly available data, reports and documents. </li>
                <li> Classified into two axes: the present (readiness, availability) and the future (Development
                    strategy, Capacity building roadmap). </li>
                <li> Composed from 13 indexes (Digital Strategy, Health Strategy and Digital Health strategy). </li>
                <li> Development of DH development strategies Taxonomy and classification. </li>
                <li> Detection of best practices and patterns of strategies development. </li>
                <li>Annually based analytics report and digital map releases.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>● Research and development landscape</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Based on published research, scientific funding, Meta data of clinical trials, Patents and Grey
                    Literature. </li>
                <li>Classified by origin and domain.</li>
                <li>Based on developed DH corpus and classification.</li>
                <li> Development of analytics service for trends detection, research funding allocation and privileged
                    areas for investment. </li>
                <li> Collaborative index space for international research and development networking and development of
                    a network of cooperation based on predefined values of exchange (data, knowledge, services, tools,
                    funds, etc.). </li>
                <li> Annually based Intelligence report and monthly updated digital Dashboard releases. </li>
            </ul>
            <p> Given the actual disparities in investment, capacity and resources, the GRM has been thought, designed
                and developed with a similarity clustering approach rather than the classical ranking approaches and
                methodologies. To achieve our goals, our development of the national strategy map is based on a neutral
                and automatized approach that makes use of advanced Natural Language Processing techniques for the
                evaluation and the clustering of different national strategies by making use of a national strategy
                taxonomy and corpus (See Fig.2). Concretely, we have created a dictionary of keywords and concepts
                relative to a National Digital Health Strategy. The available national strategies are then compared to
                the defined dictionary to estimate the level of readiness of a country (present) and the adequacy of its
                future development (Future). </p>
            <p> For the R&amp;D landscape analysis a similar work has been conducted. Firstly, a global Taxonomy and
                corpus of the Digital Health and AI space was defined. The taxonomy supplemented corpus was then used to
                search, collate and display via a web based platform (Fig.1), the findings relevant to Digital Health
                and AI in Health research, funding and development. Finally, the results and reports generated by the
                GRM were tested and verified by end users and relevant stakeholders. </p>
            <p> At the current state of development, we have a Beta release of the R&amp;D landscape and we have
                included a first batch of 23 countries in the NHDS. The validation is a flexible process from which we
                would like to know more about our potential end users expectations and needs from such tools, specific
                data and details for the specific regional customisation if any, and their feedback on the actual status
                of development. We are also in the continuous process of data sources collection and curation and our
                end users are often our first identifiers of local sources giving their knowledge of the regional
                ecosystem. </p>
